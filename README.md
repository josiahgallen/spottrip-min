# SpotTrip
##Description
**SpotTrip** is an app to document your journey and share it with friends.

Some of our most important memories are those we aquire on a trip.  Those that love to travel love it for many reasons but often times when you take a trip you snap pictures save them on your computer and never look at them again.  Jim Gaffigan makes a joke about buying a new computer when you run out of room on your old computer to hold all the pictures you never look at again. There are plenty of places to post pictures online but maybe there is a better way to organize the moment, the experience you feel when you travel?  Often years, or sadly months later, you forget what made the trip so amazing. **SpotTrip** will help the you highlight your trip in a fun and meaningful way.  

I will accomplish this by integrating the Google API along with yelp and possibly facebook(time allowing).  The user will be able to register for an account and then create a new 'trip' and then new 'spots' they visited along their journey.  Using a server I will store the user's trips with all associated pictures, journal entries, friend comments/likes, and food reviews.

**SpotTrip** will allow the user to keep track of all the important events along your journey.  Multiple Stops? Great, with this app you will be able to keep track not only of the entire trip but also save pictures and memories at important spots along the way.  The user will be able to reflect on a trip in a fun and exciting way and choose to share these memories with friends and family, as well as highligting a key moment on a trip.  For the well traveled there will also be a fun way to look back at all the places that they have been by keeping stats on all the places they have visited and highlighting all visited countries on their master trip map.
